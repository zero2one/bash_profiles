# .bash_profiles

This folder contains scripts and settings that will be loaded when you open a terminal.

The scripts and settings were created for use within an OSX environment.


## Installation
[Download](https://github.com/zero2one/bash_profiles/archive/develop.zip), unpack and move the folder to `/Users/<your username>` rename the folder to `.bash_profiles` so it becomes a hidden folder.

Or [clone](https://github.com/zero2one/bash_profiles) this repository within your home folder (`/Users/<your username>`).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zero2one/bash_profiles.git ~/.bash_profiles
```

Replace the `.bash_profile` file within your home folder (`/Users/<your username>/.bash_profile`) by removing the original file and replace it with a symlink to the `bash_profile.sh` script in the `.bash_profiles` folder.

```
$ mv ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.BAK
$ ln -s ~/.bash_profiles/bash_profile.sh ~/.bash_profile
```

Close and reopen the terminal window or reload the `.bash_profile` by running the following command:

```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```


## Enable scripts

This package has a set of predefined scripts. They are not defined by default.
You can enable them by creating a symlink from the `.bash_profiles/enabled/` folder to the script in the `.bash_profiles/available/` folder:

```
$ cd ~/.bash_profiles/enabled
$ ln -s ../available/<script name>.sh 
```

You need to reload the .bash_profile folder (or close and reopen the terminal) to get the changes applied:

```
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

The `.bash_profile` script will be loaded and will scan the enabled folder to load all `*.sh` files.


## Add aliases

The `.bash_profile` script will also load automatically all scripts in the `.bash_profiles/aliases` folder.

This folder is meant to hold scripts that define aliases, but you can put here whatever script you like to be loaded in the command line interface.

Make sure that each script starts with a shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`)


## Script included in the package

The `.bash_profiles/available`folder contains a set of predefined scripts.
See [Enable scripts](#enable-scripts) how to enable them.

This is an overview of all available scripts:


### bash_history.sh
Override the default `history` command settings for keeping and showing the bash history.

It will keep the last 100 000 commands you run trough CLI.

```
$ phpcsd /path/to/file_or_folder to check.
```

* Output the results in color.
* Exclude files that are generated by features.

**NOTE**: You need to have the coder package installed & configured using composer:

```
$ composer global require drupal/coder
$ phpcs --config-set installed_paths ~/.composer/vendor/drupal/coder/coder_sniffer
```
